# Hodoor - Rate Limiter Library (Basic Implementation)
This repository contains a basic implementation of a sliding window-based rate limiter. It provides a starting point for building a more robust rate-limiting library.  The initial idea for this project was inspired by [RedisRateLimiter](https://github.com/tangaiyun/RedisRateLimiter).

## To-Do:
1. Transform into a standalone rate limiting library.
2. Integrate with Spring Boot for easier use in Spring applications.
3. Enhance test coverage to validate the functionality of Lua scripts.
